##  Installation Guide  

### **üîπ Prerequisites**  
- Install **Python (version 3.8 or above)** from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).  
- Install **VS Code or Jupyter Notebook** for code execution.  

###  Setup Steps  

#### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shantaveer21/Plant-Disease-Detection.git
cd Plant-Disease-Detection
```

#### **2. Set Up Virtual Environment**  
Launch the terminal and run the following commands:  
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
```

#### **3. Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



##  Usage Guide  

###  Launch the Web Application
Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

###  Application Workflow  

#### **1. Upload Image**  
- Users upload a plant leaf image for disease detection.  

#### **2. Model Prediction**  
- The CNN model processes the image and predicts the disease.  

#### **3. Display Results**  
- The system displays the **disease name** with confidence scores.  


### **4. Closing the Application**  
- The app supports safe exit via the **Close Window** button.
